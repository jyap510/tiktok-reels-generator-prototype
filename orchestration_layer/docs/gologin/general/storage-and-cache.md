# Storage & Cache Management

> How to manage GoLogin's local storage, cache files, and disk usage

GoLogin stores browser data locally for each profile you run. Over time, this can consume significant disk space.

## Where GoLogin stores data

* **Windows**: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\gologin_profile_*`
* **Mac**: `/tmp/gologin_profile_*`
* **Linux**: `/tmp/gologin_profile_*`

Orbita browser binaries are stored separately and can take 500 MB--2 GB per version.

## Is it safe to delete cache files?

Yes, you can safely delete temporary profile folders when no profiles are running. These folders are recreated when you launch a profile.

**Before deleting:**

1. Make sure all GoLogin profiles are closed
2. Close the GoLogin desktop app
3. Delete folders matching `gologin_profile_*` in your temp directory

<Warning>
  Do not delete files while profiles are running. This can cause "EBUSY: resource busy" errors on Windows or corrupt active sessions.
</Warning>

## How to reduce disk usage

* Close profiles when you're done (don't leave them running overnight)
* Uninstall unused Orbita browser versions via GoLogin settings
* Periodically clear temporary profile folders
