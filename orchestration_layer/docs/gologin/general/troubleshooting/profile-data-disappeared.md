# Profile Data Disappeared

> Why your GoLogin profile data may appear to be missing and how to recover it.

## Why profile data might disappear

There are several reasons why profile data may seem to be missing in GoLogin. In most cases, the data is not permanently lost.

### After an Orbita update

When Orbita (GoLogin's browser) receives a major version update, some local data may reset. This includes:

* Browser history
* Locally cached data
* Some site-specific storage

<Info>
  Cookies and session data are preserved if the profile was synced to GoLogin's servers before the update. Always ensure your profiles are synced before updating.
</Info>

### "Profile already deleted" message

This message is misleading. In most cases, it does **not** mean your profile was actually deleted.

This message typically appears when you have reached the profile launch limit on a trial or free plan. Your profile data still exists on GoLogin's servers.

**Fix:** Upgrade to a paid plan or renew your subscription to regain access to your profiles.

### Free plan data retention

After your subscription expires, GoLogin stores your profile data on its servers for up to **180 days**. After that period, the data is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.

<Warning>
  If your subscription has been expired for a long time, renew it as soon as possible to avoid permanent data loss. Profiles are deleted 180 days after subscription expiration.
</Warning>

### After import/export

When you export and re-import a profile, not all data is included in the export. The following data is **preserved** in exports:

* Cookies
* Proxy settings
* Profile configuration (fingerprint, timezone, etc.)

The following data is **not included** in exports:

* Browser history
* Local storage and IndexedDB data
* Cached files and images

<Info>
  If you need to preserve session data across devices, use GoLogin's built-in cloud sync instead of manual export/import. Cloud sync retains more profile data than the export file format.
