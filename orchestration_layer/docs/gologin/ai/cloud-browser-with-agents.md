# Using Cloud Browser with AI Agents

> How to use Gologin Cloud Browser as a remote browser runtime for AI agents with Puppeteer/Playwright

Gologin Cloud Browser can be used as a **remote browser runtime** for AI agents.
An agent (Claude, Codex, or any tool-calling agent) can trigger your code to connect to a Cloud Browser session and perform real browser actions such as navigation, clicking, typing, and data extraction.

This enables agent workflows that require:

* JavaScript rendering and real user interactions (click, scroll, form fill)
* persistent sessions (cookies/storage) via profiles
* proxy routing and repeatable browser configuration

<Tip>
  **Don't want to write tools from scratch?** Use the [Agent Browser CLI](/cli-tools/agent-browser) or [AI Skills](/api-reference/ai-integrations/ai-skills) for ready-made agent capabilities — no Puppeteer/Playwright code needed.
</Tip>

> Note: This page describes a technical integration pattern. It does not change target websites' rules or guarantee access.

## High-level integration pattern

AI agents typically do not "connect to a browser" directly. Instead, they:

1. plan what to do next
2. call tools/functions you expose (tool calling)
3. read structured results and continue

With Gologin Cloud Browser, your tools/functions do:

1. connect to a cloud session (token + optional profile)
2. run browser actions (navigate, click, extract, screenshot)
3. return structured results back to the agent

## Recommended architecture

**AI agent (Claude / Codex / other)**
-> calls your **tool server** (your Node/Python service)
-> tool server uses **Playwright/Puppeteer**
-> connects to **Gologin Cloud Browser** (remote endpoint)
-> returns results (text/JSON/screenshot reference) back to the agent

Why this pattern:

* your Gologin token stays server-side
* you can apply rate limits, retries, logging, and safety checks
* you can reuse profiles and proxies consistently

## Prerequisites

### 1) API token (server-side)

Generate your token in the dashboard:
`Personal Area -> API Token`
[https://app.gologin.com/personalArea/TokenApi](https://app.gologin.com/personalArea/TokenApi)

> Treat the token as a secret. Do not expose it in client-side code.

### 2) (Recommended) Profiles and proxies via REST API

Cloud Browser is the execution/runtime layer. To manage profiles (create/update) and configure proxies, use the REST API:

* Profiles API: [https://gologin.com/docs/api-reference/profile](https://gologin.com/docs/api-reference/profile)
* Proxy API: [https://gologin.com/docs/api-reference/proxy](https://gologin.com/docs/api-reference/proxy)

> **Important:** If a profile has a misconfigured or unreachable proxy, the cloud browser session will fail to start with a proxy timeout error. Verify that your proxy is reachable before connecting, or set proxy mode to `none` for testing.

## Two URLs — know the difference

Gologin exposes two different URLs for Cloud Browser. They serve different purposes:

| URL                                                                  | Purpose                      | Use for                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `https://cloudbrowser.gologin.com/connect?token=...&profile=...`     | CDP endpoint                 | Puppeteer/Playwright automation |
| `https://cloudbrowser.gologin.com/browsers/{profileId}/{sessionId}/` | Streaming web UI (Live View) | Visual debugging only           |

**Only the `/connect` endpoint works for Puppeteer/Playwright.** The Live View URL returns an HTML streaming interface and cannot be used as a `browserWSEndpoint`.

## Connecting to a cloud session

Use the canonical Cloud Browser endpoint:

```
https://cloudbrowser.gologin.com/connect?token=${token}&profile=${profileId}
```

* `token` — your Gologin API token
* `profile` — profile ID (optional)
  * Use `profileId` when you want persistent sessions and controlled configuration
  * If `profile` is omitted, a new profile may be created for the session

The `/connect` endpoint starts the browser session automatically — no separate API call needed before connecting.

Implementation examples (Puppeteer/Playwright):
[https://gologin.com/docs/api-reference/cloud-browser/getting-started](https://gologin.com/docs/api-reference/cloud-browser/getting-started)

## Pre-built CLI tools vs custom tools

You have two options for giving agents browser access:

### Option A: Use Gologin CLI tools (recommended for most cases)

* **[Agent Browser CLI](/cli-tools/agent-browser)** — ready-made CLI with `open`, `snapshot`, `click`, `type`, `fill`, `screenshot`, `close`, and 30+ more commands. Includes a persistent daemon, ref-based interaction, and compact output designed for agent loops.
* **[Web Access CLI](/cli-tools/web-access)** — unified CLI combining scraping (Web Unlocker) and browser interaction in one tool.
* **[AI Skills](/api-reference/ai-integrations/ai-skills)** — plug-and-play skills for Claude Code that handle everything automatically.

### Option B: Build custom tools with Puppeteer/Playwright

If you need full control, implement a small set of wrappers around Playwright/Puppeteer and expose them as tools.

A minimal set is usually enough:

* `open_url(url)`
* `click(selector)`
* `type(selector, text)`
* `wait_for(selector | timeout)`
* `extract_text(selector | page)`
* `screenshot()`
* `close_session()`

These are not special Gologin APIs — they are thin wrappers around standard Playwright/Puppeteer commands, executed against a Cloud Browser session.

## Critical: session management across tool calls

This is the most important architectural concern for agent workflows.

An AI agent calls tools sequentially across multiple steps. Each tool call must reuse **the same browser connection** — if you create a new `puppeteer.connect()` on every tool call, you lose cookies, local storage, and page state between steps.

**Recommended pattern:** maintain a session singleton on your tool server.

```js  theme={null}
// session.js — shared browser/page instance
let _browser = null;
let _page = null;

const TOKEN = process.env.GOLOGIN_TOKEN;
const PROFILE_ID = process.env.GOLOGIN_PROFILE_ID;

async function getSession() {
  if (_browser && _browser.isConnected()) {
    return { browser: _browser, page: _page };
  }

  const cloudBrowserUrl = `https://cloudbrowser.gologin.com/connect?token=${TOKEN}&profile=${PROFILE_ID}`;
  _browser = await puppeteer.connect({
    browserWSEndpoint: cloudBrowserUrl,
    defaultViewport: null,
  });

  const pages = await _browser.pages();
  _page = pages[0] || await _browser.newPage();

  return { browser: _browser, page: _page };
}

async function closeSession() {
  if (_browser) {
    await _browser.close();
    _browser = null;
    _page = null;
  }
}

module.exports = { getSession, closeSession };
```

Each tool then calls `getSession()` to get the shared instance:

```js  theme={null}
// tools.js
const { getSession } = require('./session');

async function open_url(url) {
  const { page } = await getSession();
  await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded' });
  return { url: page.url(), title: await page.title() };
}

async function extract_text(selector) {
  const { page } = await getSession();
  const el = await page.$(selector);
  if (!el) return { found: false };
  return { found: true, text: await el.evaluate(e => e.innerText) };
}
```

## What should tools return to the agent?

Return small, structured results so the agent can continue reliably, for example:

* current URL
* extracted text / JSON
* whether an element was found
* screenshot reference (if you store it)
* error type (timeout, navigation error, etc.)

## Operational notes

* **Security:** keep the token server-side; never embed it into client apps.
* **Session management:** close sessions when done to avoid hitting concurrency limits. Call `closeSession()` when the agent workflow completes.
* **Reliability:** add retries/backoff for transient failures (timeouts, navigation errors).
* **Observability:** for debugging, you can open Live View when available. Example URL format:
  `https://cloudbrowser.gologin.com/browsers/{profileId}/{sessionId-or-view-token}/`

## Limitations

* Results depend on the target website and your configuration.
* Websites may block automation; Cloud Browser is a runtime, not a guarantee.
* Connecting to the same profile from multiple simultaneous sessions may cause conflicts — use one connection per profile at a time.
* Quotas and rate limits apply:
