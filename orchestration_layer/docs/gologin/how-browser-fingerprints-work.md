# How browser fingerprints work

When you visit a website, the browser automatically shares certain technical information required for the page to function properly. Websites can access this information through HTTP headers and JavaScript APIs.

Fingerprinting scripts collect multiple data points from the browser and device environment, such as:

* browser and operating system information
* screen resolution and display settings
* installed fonts
* language and timezone
* hardware characteristics
* graphics rendering data (Canvas and WebGL)
* audio processing data
* media devices available on the system

These data points are combined and processed to generate a **browser fingerprint** — a unique identifier that represents the configuration of the device and browser.

Websites store this fingerprint and compare it when the same user visits again. If the fingerprint matches a previously recorded configuration, the website can recognize the device even if cookies have been deleted.

Fingerprinting is widely used by websites to:

* detect suspicious login behavior
* prevent fraud and automated traffic
* identify returning visitors
* link multiple sessions to the same device

If the fingerprint changes significantly between sessions, the website may treat the browser as a new or potentially suspicious device.

Gologin solves this by creating **isolated browser profiles**. Each profile has its own fingerprint configuration, allowing it to behave like a separate device. This makes it possible to manage multiple accounts while keeping their browser environments independent.
