# Installing custom extensions

**Custom extensions** allow you to use private, modified, or locally developed tools inside your Gologin profiles. Unlike public extensions, custom extensions are installed manually using extension files.

## Ensuring your extension is compatible

**Gologin doesn't support .crx or .zip archives.** However, you can convert such files to an **unpacked folder**, which is supported by Gologin.

If you have a **.zip** archive, just extract it - the resulting folder can be added as a custom extension.

In case you have a **.crx** file:

1. Rename your extension.crx to extension.zip
2. Extract it using the 7-zip app or your operating system's built-in extractor

<Warning>
  Make sure the extracted folder contains **manifest.json** and other extension assets (js, html, icons, etc.). \
  If you're unable to add the extension, check for the manifext.json
</Warning>

## Installing an unpacked extension

Gologin supports extensions as **unpacked folders**. To install such an extension:

1. **Click 3 dots on the profile** you want to install the extension on, then click **Settings**
2. Navigate to the **Extensions** tab and click **Add extensions**
3. Click the **Upload custom extension** button
4. Open the folder that contains the extension and click **Select folder**
5. Hit **Save** to apply the changes
