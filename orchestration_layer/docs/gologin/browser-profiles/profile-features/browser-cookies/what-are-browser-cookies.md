# What are browser cookies

**Cookies** are small data files created by websites and stored in your browser.

Cookies usually include:

* Login session tokens
* “Remember me” authentication
* Language and region settings
* Shopping cart data
* Tracking identifiers
* Anti-fraud trust signals

When working with multi-account setups, cookies often determine whether a website sees your session as trusted or suspicious.

## How cookies work in Gologin

Each Gologin profile:

* Has its own isolated cookie storage
* Does not share cookies with other profiles
* Syncs cookies to the cloud when the profile is properly closed
* Restores cookies when the profile is launched again

This means every profile behaves like a separate physical device, as long as you use different proxies for each profile.

## Proxy and Fingerprint consistency

Cookies alone do not guarantee account access.

For successful cookie import:

* Use the same or geographically consistent proxy
* Keep timezone aligned with IP
* Avoid major fingerprint changes
* Do not mix mobile cookies with desktop fingerprints

If the IP country or device fingerprint changes drastically, websites may invalidate the session.

## Best practices

* Always close profiles properly to sync cookies
* Keep proxy geography consistent
* Export cookies before making major changes
* Test imports on non-critical accounts first
* Avoid frequent cookie swapping on established accounts
