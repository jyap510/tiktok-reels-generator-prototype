# Profile fingerprint settings

Gologin allows you to configure fingerprint parameters when creating or editing a browser profile.

These settings define how your browser profile appears to websites and anti-fraud systems.

Websites collect multiple technical signals from the browser environment and combine them into a **browser fingerprint** used to identify devices.

Fingerprint settings in Gologin are grouped into several categories.

## Navigator fingerprint

Navigator parameters describe the general browser and device environment.

Websites read these values using JavaScript APIs such as `navigator.userAgent` and `navigator.platform`.

Common navigator parameters include:

* **User-Agent** – identifies the browser type, version, and operating system
* **Orbita version** – the Chromium version used by the profile
* **Screen resolution** – the screen size reported to websites
* **Languages** – preferred browser languages
* **Platform** – operating system platform
* **CPU threads** – number of processor cores reported to the browser
* **RAM** – available device memory
* **DoNotTrack** – privacy preference signal

These parameters help websites determine what type of device is being used.

## Fonts

Fonts installed in the browser environment are another fingerprint signal.

Websites can detect fonts by measuring how text renders on the page. Different operating systems and devices have different font sets, which helps distinguish devices.

Gologin can mask the fonts list to generate realistic combinations that match the selected operating system.

## Media devices

Media device settings define what cameras, microphones, and audio outputs are visible to websites.

Websites can access this information using the `navigator.mediaDevices` API.

Gologin allows you to mask:

* video inputs
* audio inputs
* audio outputs

This helps prevent websites from identifying your real hardware configuration.

## Hardware fingerprint

Hardware-related signals provide additional entropy for browser fingerprinting.

These parameters include graphical and audio rendering characteristics.

### Canvas

The Canvas API allows websites to draw hidden images in the browser.\
Because rendering differs slightly between devices, the resulting image can be converted into a hash and used for fingerprinting.

### WebGL

WebGL reveals information about the graphics hardware used by the device.

Websites may inspect the WebGL report or render a hidden 3D object to generate a fingerprint.

### AudioContext

Audio fingerprinting uses differences in audio processing to generate a unique hash.

### ClientRects

This method measures how elements are positioned and rendered on the page.

Gologin allows you to modify or mask these signals to generate a consistent but unique fingerprint for each profile.

## WebRTC

WebRTC is a technology used for real-time communication in browsers.

However, it can expose local or real IP addresses to websites.

GoLogin allows you to control WebRTC behavior:

* **Based on IP** – WebRTC reports the proxy IP
* **Off** – WebRTC is disabled

This helps prevent IP leaks and keeps the fingerprint consistent with the proxy location.

## Best practice

To maintain stable browser identities:

* keep fingerprint settings consistent after accounts are created
* match timezone and language with the proxy location
* avoid frequent changes to hardware-related parameters
* use a dedicated proxy for each profile

Stable fingerprints help websites recognize the profile as a consistent device.

## How to verify your fingerprint

After launching a profile, visit one of these sites to check your fingerprint:

* [**iphey.com**](https://iphey.com) -- Shows an overall trust score. A green "Trusted" result means your profile looks like a real browser.
* [**pixelscan.net**](https://pixelscan.net) -- Detailed breakdown of individual fingerprint parameters.

### Common issues and what they mean

| Issue               | Meaning                                            | Fix                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OS mismatch         | Profile OS doesn't match your real device OS       | Create a new profile matching your actual OS                                                   |
| WebGL mismatch      | GPU information inconsistent with claimed hardware | Usually auto-configured correctly. If flagged, try a different WebGL mode in profile settings. |
| Timezone mismatch   | Timezone doesn't match proxy location              | GoLogin auto-matches timezone to proxy IP. If wrong, check your proxy location.                |
| Canvas hash changed | Canvas fingerprint differs between sessions        | Set Canvas to "Off" or "Block" instead of "Add Noise" for consistency across devices           |
