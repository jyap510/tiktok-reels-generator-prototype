# Crypto & KYC Platforms

Crypto platforms split into two categories: exchanges and wallets (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) where KYC ties the account to a real person, and airdrop/farming platforms (Galxe, Zealy, Layer3, Premint) where the goal is managing multiple accounts across campaigns.

## Quick checklist

* 1 account = 1 browser profile
* 1 profile = 1 static residential proxy
* Keep proxy location consistent — especially after KYC
* Do not change fingerprint or proxy after identity verification
* For farming: treat accounts as disposable — don't mix farming and real exchange accounts

## Exchanges & KYC platforms

After KYC, consistency is everything. A login from a new IP or a changed fingerprint triggers a security review, additional verification, or account freeze.

### Gologin profile setup

* \*\*Proxy:\*\* static residential — same IP for every session
* \*\*Proxy location:\*\* match the country on your identity documents if possible

<Warning>
  Never change the proxy on a Gologin profile after completing KYC on a crypto exchange. The exchange stores your device environment at verification time. A different IP or fingerprint on the next login is treated as account takeover.
</Warning>

## Warmup timeline

| **Period** | **Focus**          | **What to do**                                   |
| :--------- | :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| Day 0      | Registration       | Account creation + email verification            |
| Days 1–3   | KYC                | Submit identity documents, complete verification |
| Days 4–7   | Exploration        | Browse the platform, explore trading interface   |
| Week 2     | Small transactions | Deposit a small amount, make 1–2 trades          |
| Week 3+    | Normal use         | Regular trading activity                         |

### Common ban triggers — exchanges

* IP change after KYC (even same country, different city)
* Device fingerprint mismatch between sessions
* Large deposits immediately after account creation
* Multiple accounts with same payment method or bank account

## Airdrop & Points Farming (Galxe, Zealy, Premint, Layer3)

Web3 campaigns — airdrops, quests, points programs — often allow one entry per person. Gologin is used here to manage multiple legitimate accounts (for example, for a team where each member participates separately) while keeping those accounts technically isolated from each other.

### **SHow platforms detect linked accounts**

Platforms use two types of signals:

Browser and network signals (what Gologin addresses):

* Same IP address across multiple accounts
* Same browser fingerprint
* Accounts completing tasks at identical times from the same environment

On-chain signals (outside Gologin's scope):

* Blockchains are public — all transactions are permanently visible
* If multiple wallet addresses receive funds from the same source wallet, they are trivially linked on-chain
* Platforms use tools like Nansen or Arkham to analyze wallet relationships before distributing tokens

Gologin isolates the browser environment and IP. On-chain wallet relationships are a separate concern each user manages according to their own setup and the platform's rules.

### Gologin setup for multi-account campaigns

If you are managing accounts on behalf of multiple team members, each person should have:

* A dedicated Gologin profile
* A unique residential proxy
* Their own connected wallet — not funded from a shared team wallet

### Managing at scale

For teams with 10+ accounts across campaigns:

* Organize profiles in Gologin folders by campaign or team member
* Use tags to track status (active, completed, pending)
* Use the Gologin API to launch and manage profiles programmatically
* Keep a record of which profile corresponds to which team member and wallet
