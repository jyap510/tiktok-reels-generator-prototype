# What’s safe to change

When managing accounts with GoLogin, maintaining a consistent browser fingerprint is important.\
Websites often analyze changes in browser configuration to detect unusual activity.

Some profile settings can be safely modified at any time, while others should remain stable once an account has started using the profile.

## Safe to change

The following settings can usually be changed without affecting the browser fingerprint or account trust:

* profile name
* notes
* folders and tags
* extensions
* proxy credentials (if the proxy location stays consistent)

These settings do not affect the core fingerprint signals used by websites.

## Change carefully

Some parameters may influence the browser environment and should be modified carefully.

These include:

* timezone
* language settings
* WebRTC mode
* media devices configuration

If changes are required, try to keep them consistent with the proxy location and device type.

## Avoid changing after accounts are created

Certain parameters form the core of the browser fingerprint.\
Changing them frequently may cause websites to treat the browser as a new device.

Avoid modifying these settings after accounts are logged into the profile:

* operating system
* user agent
* screen resolution
* fonts configuration
* Canvas fingerprint
* WebGL fingerprint
* AudioContext fingerprint
* CPU threads and RAM values

Major changes to these parameters may trigger additional verification or login checks.

## Best practice

For the most stable results:

* create a profile and configure its fingerprint before logging into accounts
* keep fingerprint settings stable after accounts are added
* use a dedicated proxy for each profile
* avoid frequent changes to hardware-related parameters

Maintaining a consistent fingerprint helps websites recognize the profile as a stable device.
