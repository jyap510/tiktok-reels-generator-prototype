# Static vs Rotating proxies

### Static proxies

Static proxies use a fixed IP address that remains the same over time.

They are recommended for long-term account management where a stable login location is required.

### Sticky proxies

Sticky proxies maintain the same IP address for a limited session period (usually 10–30 minutes) before rotating.

They are useful when short-term session consistency is needed, also good for account management.

### Rotating proxies

Rotating proxies automatically assign a new IP address from a proxy pool.

Rotation may occur:

* on every request
* after a session ends
* after a set time interval

They are typically used for high-volume scraping or data collection. They generally can be used for account management if they keep the same IP during the session.

### Which type for which platform?

| Platform              | Recommended proxy type             | Why                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LinkedIn              | Static residential or mobile       | IP changes trigger immediate security review                               |
| Facebook / Meta Ads   | Static residential or sticky       | Geo-consistency required for ad accounts                                   |
| Amazon / eBay / Etsy  | Static ISP                         | Rotating IPs link accounts and trigger bans                                |
| TikTok (new accounts) | Mobile                             | Mobile IPs have highest trust for account creation                         |
| Web scraping          | Rotating residential or datacenter | Speed and volume matter more than consistency                              |
| Betting platforms     | Mobile                             | Highest trust level, platforms are aggressive against desktop fingerprints |

<Warning>
  Using rotating proxies for Amazon seller accounts is a common mistake that leads to account bans. Amazon links accounts by IP - if your IP rotates, multiple accounts may be flagged as connected.
</Warning>
