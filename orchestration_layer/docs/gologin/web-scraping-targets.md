# Web scraping targets

Gologin works as a scraping browser — instead of a headless browser with a generic fingerprint, your scraper runs through isolated profiles that look like real users. This dramatically reduces detection rates on sites that fingerprint browsers, not just block IPs.

## Quick checklist

* 1 scraping session = 1 browser profile
* Choose proxy type based on target site protection level
* Reuse profiles across sessions to preserve cookies and session state
* Control request speed — scrapers get blocked by behavior, not just IP
* For scale (50+ concurrent): use the GoLogin API, not the desktop app

## Choosing your setup

### Manual scraping (Gologin desktop app)

Best for: small-scale data collection, sites that require login, manual-assisted workflows. Open profiles from the Gologin app and scrape inside the browser window.

### API-based scraping (Puppeteer / Playwright / Selenium)

Best for: automated workflows, 10+ concurrent sessions, scheduled scraping. Gologin launches the profile and returns a WebSocket endpoint that your automation script connects to.

See API [Quickstart ](https://gologin.com/docs/api-reference/introduction/quickstart)for full setup.

## Step 1. Choose proxy strategy

| **Target**                               | **Recommended proxy** | **Notes**                |
| :--------------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------- |
| Low-protection sites                     | Datacenter rotating   | Fast and cheap           |
| Medium-protection sites                  | Residential rotating  | Better trust score       |
| High-protection (Cloudflare, PerimeterX) | Residential rotating  | Required                 |
| Sites requiring login / account state    | Residential static    | Keeps session consistent |
| Price comparison, marketplaces           | Residential rotating  | Different IP per request |

## Step 2. Manage sessions and cookies

Gologin profiles persist cookies automatically between sessions — you log in once, the profile stays authenticated. Avoid clearing cookies after every run — it breaks session continuity and looks like bot behavior.

## Step 3. Control request patterns

Detection is mostly about behavior, not just IP. Practical timing guidelines:

| **Scraping intensity**       | **Delay between requests** |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| Light (avoid detection)      | 3–8 seconds, randomized    |
| Medium                       | 1–3 seconds, randomized    |
| Aggressive (high block risk) | 0.5–1 second               |

Always randomize delays — a fixed interval is a detection signal.

## Step 4. Scale with multiple profiles

For parallel scraping, launch multiple profiles via the API simultaneously. Check Rate Limits before launching many profiles — API limits apply.

### **Practical limits by plan**

* Professional: up to \~10 concurrent profiles comfortably
* Business: up to \~30 concurrent profiles
* Enterprise: 100+ concurrent profiles

Hardware is also a constraint — each profile is a browser instance. 10 concurrent profiles requires \~8–16 GB RAM.

## Cloudflare and anti-bot systems

Gologin handles browser fingerprint challenges (Canvas, WebGL, TLS fingerprint). It does not solve CAPTCHA automatically. If a target site uses Cloudflare with CAPTCHA, integrate a CAPTCHA solving service (2captcha, CapSolver, Anti-Captcha) into your scraping script.

## Common detection signals

* Identical timing between requests
* No scroll or mouse events before clicking
* Direct navigation to deep URLs without referrer
* Canvas or WebGL fingerprint that doesn't match the claimed OS/browser
