# How Gologin proxies work 

Gologin proxies are integrated directly into the Gologin environment and can be attached to browser profiles without additional configuration.

When a proxy is assigned to a profile, all internet traffic from that profile is routed through the proxy server. This means websites see the proxy IP address instead of your real IP address.

Using separate proxies for different profiles helps keep sessions isolated and reduces the chance that multiple accounts will be linked together.

### How traffic is routed

When a proxy is assigned to a Gologin browser profile, all network requests from that profile are routed through the proxy server.

The process works as follows:

1. A browser profile sends a request to open a website.
2. The request is first sent to the proxy server assigned to that profile.
3. The proxy forwards the request to the destination website.
4. The website sends the response back to the proxy server.
5. The proxy returns the response to the browser profile.

Because of this routing process, the website sees the **proxy IP address** instead of the real IP address of your device.

Each browser profile can use a different proxy, which helps isolate sessions and makes profiles appear as separate browsing environments.

## Available proxy types

Depending on your plan, Gologin may offer several proxy types, including:

* Residential rotating
* Mobile rotating
* Datacenter sticky

For a detailed explanation of proxy types, see **Proxy Types**.
