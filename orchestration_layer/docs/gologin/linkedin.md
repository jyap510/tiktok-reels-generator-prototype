# LinkedIn

A practical guide to managing LinkedIn accounts with Gologin — covering lead generation, outreach, farming, and team access.

LinkedIn is one of the most security-sensitive platforms in the Gologin ecosystem. It monitors login patterns, IP consistency, and device fingerprints more aggressively than most social networks. Accounts that show suspicious signals are restricted quickly, sometimes without warning.

## Quick checklist

Before you start:

* 1 account = 1 browser profile
* 1 profile = 1 static residential or mobile proxy
* Never change the proxy on a profile that's been used
* Match profile OS to your device OS
* Don't open the same profile on two devices at the same time

## Step 1. Choose the right proxy

LinkedIn is highly sensitive to IP changes. Use a static residential proxy or static mobile proxy — one dedicated IP that stays the same across sessions.

<Warning>
  Do not use rotating proxies, datacenter proxies, or Gologin's built-in proxies for LinkedIn accounts you care about. A changing IP between sessions will trigger an immediate security review and often a session logout.
</Warning>

If you and your team member are in the same city, you can use the same country/city proxy location. If your team is distributed, each person should use a proxy that matches the geographic region of the LinkedIn account — not where the team member physically sits.

Recommended proxy types for LinkedIn:

* Static residential (best for long-term account management)
* Mobile (good for new account creation and warmup)
* ISP proxies (stable, decent trust level)

See [Recommended proxy providers](https://gologin.com/best-proxy-server-services/) for specific services.

## Step 2. Set up your Gologin profile

Create a new profile for each LinkedIn account.

Recommended settings:

* **OS**: match your device (Windows if you're on Windows, Mac if you're on Mac)
* **Proxy**: assign your static proxy before the first login
* **Fingerprint**: leave defaults — do not customize WebGL, Canvas, or AudioContext unless you have a specific reason

Once you've logged into LinkedIn in a profile, **do not change the proxy or fingerprint settings.** LinkedIn stores device information server-side. A fingerprint change looks like a completely new device attempting to access the account.

## Step 3. Warm up new accounts

New LinkedIn accounts that immediately send connection requests or messages get restricted fast. LinkedIn expects new accounts to behave like real users — browsing, reading, building a presence gradually.

Warmup timeline:

| Period   | What to do                                                     |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Day 0    | Complete profile: photo, headline, about section, work history |
| Day 1-7  | Browse feed, view profiles, follow a few companies             |
| Day 8-14 | Like and comment on posts. No outreach yet                     |
| Week 3   | Send 5–10 connection requests to people you "know"             |
| Week 4+  | Begin gradual outreach. Increase limits slowly                 |

Safe activity levels

| **Action**      | **Recommended level** |
| :-------------- | :-------------------- |
| Likes / upvotes | 10–20 / day           |
| Comments        | 2–3 / day             |
| Posts / answers | Occasional            |
| Community joins | Gradual               |

These are conservative estimates. LinkedIn's actual limits vary by account age, activity history, and subscription type.

## Step 4. Avoid common bans

Things that trigger LinkedIn restrictions immediately:

* Logging in from a new IP after the account was already active (use static proxies)
* Opening the same profile on two devices simultaneously
* Sending identical messages to many people in a short time
* Creating multiple accounts on the same day with the same profile setup pattern
* Using automation tools that don't maintain a consistent session (see automation section below)

Things that trigger restrictions gradually:

* High connection request volume without acceptance rate
* Many profile views without engagement
* Posting the same content across multiple accounts
* Accounts with no activity for weeks, then sudden mass outreach

## Step 5. Share access with your team

To let a team member access a LinkedIn account in Gologin:

1. Share the profile with them using **Profile Sharing** (they need a free Gologin account)
2. Assign the role \*\*Can run\*\* if they only need to open and work in it
3. Assign **Can edit** if they also need to change settings

<Warning>
  Only one person should be working in a LinkedIn profile at a time. LinkedIn detects concurrent sessions from different locations and will log out both sessions or trigger a security check.
</Warning>

See[ Sharing profiles](https://gologin.com/docs/general/team-collaboration/sharing-profiles) for step-by-step instructions.

## Automation tools

Gologin is compatible with common LinkedIn automation tools. The key requirement is that the automation runs inside the Gologin profile — not as a separate browser extension in a regular Chrome window.

Compatible approach:

* Run automation tools as Chrome extensions installed inside the Gologin profile
* Use Gologin's API to launch the profile, then attach the automation to the running browser session

Incompatible approach:

* Running automation in a regular Chrome window while also using Gologin (the sessions are separate and can conflict)
* Using automation tools that open their own browser outside Gologin

Automation should always respect LinkedIn's daily limits. High-volume automation with no warmup is the fastest path to account restriction.

## Migrating profiles from another antidetect browser

If you're moving from Dolphin Anty, Multilogin, or another antidetect browser, the browser profile data (cookies, sessions, local storage) can be exported and imported into Gologin.

Steps:

1. Export cookies from your existing antidetect browser (most support JSON export)
2. In Gologin, open the target profile and go to **Cookies**
3. Import the cookie file

This preserves your LinkedIn session so you don't need to log in again. The fingerprint will be different (Gologin generates its own), but as long as the proxy IP stays the same, LinkedIn will typically accept the session as the same device.

## Why LinkedIn logs sessions out

LinkedIn session logouts are almost always caused by one of these:

* Proxy IP changed — even a small IP change triggers a security review
* Profile opened on a different OS — fingerprint inconsistency
* Profile opened on two devices at once — concurrent session detected
* Long inactivity followed by sudden activity — looks like account takeover
* Automation detected — unusual action patterns at non-human speed

If you're seeing frequent logouts, check your proxy first — static vs rotating is the most common cause.
