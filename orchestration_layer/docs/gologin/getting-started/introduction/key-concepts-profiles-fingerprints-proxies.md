# Key concepts

To use Gologin effectively, it is important to understand three core concepts that define how browser environments are separated and protected.

These components work together to create independent browsing identities for each account.

## Browser profiles

A **browser profile** in Gologin is an isolated browser environment that simulates a separate device.

Each profile contains its own:

* browser fingerprint
* cookies and session data
* local storage and cache
* browser extensions
* proxy connection

Because profiles are isolated from each other, websites treat them as different users or devices.

This allows you to manage multiple accounts without sessions interfering with each other, which becomes especially important when working with multiple accounts at scale, as described in \
[Managing existing accounts](https://gologin.com/docs/managing-existing-accounts).

## Browser fingerprints

A **browser fingerprint** is a set of technical parameters that websites use to identify a device.

These parameters may include:

* operating system
* browser version
* screen resolution
* installed fonts
* graphics and WebGL data
* timezone and language settings

Gologin generates a unique fingerprint for each profile so that websites see every profile as a different device.

A browser fingerprint determines how websites identify your device. To understand this in detail, see \
[How browser fingerprints work](https://gologin.com/docs/how-browser-fingerprints-work).

## Proxies

A **proxy** assigns a different IP address to a browser profile.

Since websites track both browser fingerprints and IP addresses, using proxies helps separate network identities between profiles.

With proxies, each profile can appear to connect from a different location or network.

Using a proxy together with a unique browser fingerprint helps create a consistent and independent browsing identity.

Proxies are used to separate accounts at the network level.  If you're not familiar with how they work, start with [What is a proxy](https://gologin.com/docs/proxy/introduction/what-is-a-proxy).

Once you understand these components, the next step is applying them when creating profiles. \
See [Creating profiles](https://gologin.com/docs/browser-profiles/profile-management/creating-and-launching-profiles).

## Profile OS must match your device OS

The operating system set in your profile fingerprint should match the OS of the device you're using to open the profile. For example:

* Opening a Windows profile on a Mac can create detectable mismatches
* Sites like iphey.com and pixelscan.net will flag this as a fingerprint inconsistency
* LinkedIn and other sensitive platforms may log you out immediately

<Warning>
  If you work on a Mac, create Mac profiles. If you work on Windows, create Windows profiles. Cross-platform usage (creating on one OS, opening on another) can compromise your accounts.
</Warning>

## Default fingerprint settings are safe

GoLogin automatically generates realistic fingerprint settings for each new profile. You do not need to customize WebGL, Canvas, Audio, or other fingerprint parameters unless you have a specific reason to do so.

## How to verify your fingerprint

After launching a profile, visit one of these checkers:

* **iphey.com** -- shows an overall trust score and flags issues
* **pixelscan.net** -- detailed fingerprint analysis

A "green" or "trusted" result means your profile looks like a real browser to websites.
