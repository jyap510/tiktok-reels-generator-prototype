# What is Gologin Cloud Browser

Gologin Cloud Browser lets you run a Gologin (Orbita) browser **in the cloud** and control it from your automation code (Puppeteer / Playwright) using a single **connection URL**.

It is a [headless browser](./what-is-headless-browser) — a browser controlled entirely by code, without a graphical interface — hosted and managed by Gologin, with built-in support for persistent profiles, fingerprint configuration, and proxy routing.

## What you can do with Cloud Browser

* Run multiple browser sessions in parallel in the cloud
* Automate with your existing stack (Puppeteer / Playwright)
* Use Gologin **profiles** to keep persistent state (logins, cookies, storage)
* Route traffic through **proxies** by configuring them on the profile
* Use it with AI agents as a remote browser runtime

## How it differs from a standard headless browser

A standard headless Chrome is detectable. Websites use browser fingerprinting to identify automated traffic — checking canvas rendering, WebGL parameters, fonts, timezone, screen size, and dozens of other signals.

Gologin Cloud Browser runs **Orbita** — a modified Chromium that manages fingerprint signals to match a consistent, realistic browser profile. Combined with persistent cookies and proxy configuration stored in each profile, your sessions look stable and human across repeated visits.

## Why Gologin Cloud Browser

### Anti-detect built in — no plugins needed

Standard headless Chrome is trivially detectable. Other cloud browser services run stock Chromium and require third-party stealth plugins to reduce fingerprint signals — with mixed results.

Gologin Cloud Browser runs **Orbita**, a hardened Chromium build with fingerprint management at the core: canvas, WebGL, fonts, timezone, screen resolution, and more. Anti-detect is not a patch on top — it is the browser.

### Persistent profiles — sessions that remember

Most cloud browser services treat each session as stateless. Cookies and storage are discarded when the session closes.

Gologin profiles persist. Log in once, close the session, reconnect later — the profile retains its cookies, local storage, and all configured settings. No re-authentication, no session warm-up.

### Predictable pricing — billed by time, not by traffic

|                     | Gologin Cloud Browser               | Typical alternative          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Session billing** | Hourly ( 0.048/h depending on plan) | Per session or per hour      |
| **Proxy traffic**   | \$1.99 / GB                         | Per MB (minimum per session) |
| **ISP proxies**     | \$5 / IP, unlimited traffic         | Per GB                       |
| **Included hours**  | 20–200 h/month depending on plan    | Usually none                 |

### No vendor lock-in

Gologin Cloud Browser is a standard CDP endpoint. Your Puppeteer or Playwright code connects to it the same way it would connect to any remote Chrome instance — no proprietary SDK, no custom API to learn. Switch in or out with a single URL change.

### Parallel sessions that scale

Plans include 1–4 parallel sessions out of the box. Need more — contact us for a custom plan.

## Common technical scenarios

Cloud Browser is typically used for workflows where you:

* log into a web account once and keep the session persistent via a profile
* run repeated actions on the same websites across many profiles
* need stable, long-running sessions without depending on a local machine

Examples include automating logged-in sessions for web apps, marketplaces, or social platforms where persistence and consistent profile settings matter.

## Core concepts

* **Profile** — a reusable browser identity (cookies/storage + fingerprint and proxy settings).
* **Cloud session** — a running instance of a profile in GoLogin's cloud.
* **Connect URL** — the endpoint you pass to your automation tool to control the cloud session.

## How it works (high level)

1. (Recommended) Create and configure a profile via the Gologin REST API (proxy, fingerprint, etc.).
2. Connect to Cloud Browser using your **dev token** and optional `profileId`.
3. Automate the session with Puppeteer or Playwright.
4. Close the connection when you're done.

## Connection URL

Use this URL as the remote browser endpoint:

```text  theme={null}
https://cloudbrowser.gologin.com/connect?token=${token}&profile=${params.profileId}
```

* `token` — your Gologin **dev token** (generate it in the dashboard: `Personal Area → API Token`).
* `profile` — **profile ID** (optional). If omitted, a new profile will be created for the session.

## Managing profiles (proxy, fingerprint, etc.)

Cloud Browser is the **connection layer**.\
To create/update profiles, attach proxies, and configure profile settings, use the Gologin REST API:

* Profiles API: [https://gologin.com/docs/api-reference/profile](https://gologin.com/docs/api-reference/profile)
* Proxy API: [https://gologin.com/docs/api-reference/proxy](https://gologin.com/docs/api-reference/proxy)

## Use Cloud Browser from the CLI

If you prefer shell commands over writing Puppeteer/Playwright code, Gologin provides agent-friendly CLI tools:

* **[Gologin Agent Browser CLI](/cli-tools/agent-browser)** — cloud browser CLI with daemon, page snapshots, ref-based interaction. Built for AI agents.
* **[Gologin Web Access CLI](/cli-tools/web-access)** — unified CLI combining Web Unlocker scraping with Cloud Browser interaction in one tool.

```bash  theme={null}
npm install -g gologin-agent-browser-cli
export GOLOGIN_TOKEN='your_token'

gologin-agent-browser open https://example.com
gologin-agent-browser snapshot
gologin-agent-browser click @e3
gologin-agent-browser screenshot ./page.png
gologin-agent-browser close
```
