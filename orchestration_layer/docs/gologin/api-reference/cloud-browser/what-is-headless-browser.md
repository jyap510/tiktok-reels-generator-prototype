# What is a Headless Browser

A headless browser is a web browser controlled by code — it visits pages, clicks buttons, fills forms, and extracts data automatically, without a visible graphical interface.

It works exactly like Chrome or Firefox, but runs on a server. No screen required.

## How it works

Modern browsers expose a control protocol called **Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)**. Automation libraries like Playwright and Puppeteer use CDP to send commands to the browser: navigate to this URL, click this element, read this text, take a screenshot.

GoLogin Cloud Browser is built on top of this same protocol — your Puppeteer or Playwright code connects to a remote browser over CDP and controls it the same way it would a local one.

## Why use a headless browser instead of a regular HTTP request?

Many websites today load their content dynamically via JavaScript. A simple HTTP request fetches only the raw HTML — it misses everything rendered client-side.

A headless browser executes JavaScript just like a real user's browser does, which means it can:

* Wait for content to load after the page renders
* Interact with dynamic elements (dropdowns, modals, infinite scroll)
* Handle login flows, multi-step forms, and SPAs
* Pass bot detection checks that HTTP clients cannot

## Why run it in the cloud?

Running a headless browser locally is straightforward. Running it reliably in production is not.

Managing browser processes in production requires handling:

* **Crashes and restarts** — browsers crash; infrastructure needs to recover automatically
* **Concurrency** — multiple parallel sessions require resource isolation
* **Scaling** — traffic spikes require spinning up more instances on demand
* **Memory leaks** — long-running browser sessions accumulate memory

GoLogin Cloud Browser handles all of this infrastructure so you connect to a ready session via a single URL and focus on your automation logic.

## Why GoLogin specifically?

A standard headless Chrome is detectable. Websites use browser fingerprinting to identify automation — checking canvas rendering, WebGL parameters, font lists, timezone, screen size, and dozens of other signals.

Gologin Cloud Browser runs a modified Chromium (Orbita) that manages these fingerprint signals to match a real user's browser profile. Combined with persistent cookies and proxy configuration baked into each profile, sessions look consistent and human across multiple visits.

This matters for any automation targeting websites with antibot protection.

## Common automation frameworks

Gologin Cloud Browser works with any library that supports CDP:

| Library        | Language                    | Notes                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Puppeteer**  | Node.js                     | Google's CDP library, widely used |
| **Playwright** | Node.js, Python, Java, .NET | Modern API, multi-browser support |
| **Selenium**   | Most languages              | Oldest, broadest ecosystem        |
