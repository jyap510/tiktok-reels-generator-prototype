# Amazon, eBay, Shopify

E-commerce marketplaces are the most aggressive at account linking. Amazon, eBay, and Shopify all maintain cross-account graphs — if two accounts share an IP, a payment method, a device fingerprint, or a shipping address, the platform will connect them. When one account is suspended, the linked accounts typically follow.

## Quick checklist

* 1 seller account = 1 browser profile
* 1 profile = 1 static residential or ISP proxy
* **Never use rotating proxies** — IP changes link accounts instantly
* **Never use Gologin built-in proxies** — they are rotating by default
* Unique payment method per account
* Unique phone number and email per account

## Step 1. Set up your Gologin profile

* \*\*Proxy: \*\*static residential or ISP proxy — one dedicated IP per account, never shared
* \*\*Fingerprint: \*\*leave defaults

## Step 2. Warm up the account

| **Period** | **Focus**      | **What to do**                        |
| :--------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| Day 0      | Setup          | Registration + identity verification  |
| Days 1–3   | Exploration    | Browse seller tools, read policies    |
| Days 4–7   | Light activity | Add 5–10 listings, set up shipping    |
| Week 2     | Normal use     | Manage listings, respond to questions |
| Week 3+    | Scale          | Increase listing volume gradually     |

## Safe activity patterns

| Action             | Recommended approach |
| :----------------- | :------------------- |
| Product listings   | Add gradually        |
| Account edits      | Occasional updates   |
| Dashboard activity | Regular browsing     |
| Order processing   | Consistent handling  |

## Payment isolation

This is the most common reason marketplace accounts get linked and suspended together.

Each account needs:

* A unique credit or debit card
* A unique PayPal account (if used)
* A unique billing address

Options that work: Revolut, Wise, N26 (multiple virtual cards), Privacy.com (US), prepaid debit cards.

<Warning>
  Sharing a card across Amazon seller accounts is treated as a Terms of Service violation. Amazon will suspend all linked accounts and hold funds for up to 90 days.
</Warning>

## Platform-specific notes

### Amazon

* IP changes between sessions trigger automatic account linking review
* Appeals are hard — prevention is far easier than recovery
* Business accounts require verified legal entity documents

### eBay

* Less strict than Amazon on IP, but still tracks device fingerprint
* Each account needs separate bank details for eBay Managed Payments
* Feedback score matters — new accounts have low buyer trust

### Shopify

* GoLogin is mainly used to manage multiple Shopify admin accounts or run operations from different locations
* No cross-account detection like Amazon/eBay, but Shopify Payments has fraud detection on payouts

## Common ban triggers

### Amazon

* Rotating or shared proxy IPs
* Same payment method across accounts
* Same device fingerprint on multiple seller logins
* Related account suspension (Amazon bans by association)

### eBay

* Same IP or fingerprint as a previously suspended account
* Listing the same items across multiple accounts simultaneously
* Feedback manipulation patterns
